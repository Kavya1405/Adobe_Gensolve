CURVETOPIA: A Journey into the World of Curves Project
Overview
This project focuses on detecting and completing curves in images using OpenCV and other image processing techniques. The main objectives are:

Detecting Symmetric Curves: Identify and count symmetric curves in images.
Completing Incomplete Curves: Use inpainting techniques to complete curves that are partially missing.
The project includes the following functionalities:

Symmetric Curve Detection: Identifies curves in images that exhibit horizontal or vertical symmetry.
Curve Completion: Uses inpainting to fill in incomplete curves in images.
Features
Symmetric Curve Detection:

Detects symmetric curves using edge detection and contour analysis.
Highlights symmetric curves in the output image.
Curve Completion:

Completes curves using the inpainting technique.
Provides visualizations of the original image, mask, and completed curves.
